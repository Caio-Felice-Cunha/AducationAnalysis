## Business Problem
> Data source: The data were provided by the Data Science Academy, which used the Realistic Data Generator (https://www.mockaroo.com/)

The analysis was done to bring insights to a network of schools that aims to better understand the market.<br>
It was necessary to understand the performance of students, how much is invested in each school, which indicators resulted in better results for Mathematics and Writing, among other questions.

## Business Assumptions
It is assumed that the schools belong to slightly different regions and that the culture in which they are located is similar. <br>
It is also understood that the school network wants to understand how the market works in order to take better advantage of it and improve its methods.

## Solution Strategy
To perform the analysis, we used only the Python Pandas library, as well as the creation of subtables for a better analysis.

## Next Steps
