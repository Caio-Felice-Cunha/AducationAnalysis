## This is the 2nd version
### Improvements compared to the last version:
* Power BI Dashboard (Report)
* Report

## Business Problem
> Data source: The data were provided by the Data Science Academy, which used the Realistic Data Generator (https://www.mockaroo.com/)

The analysis was done to bring insights to a network of schools that aims to better understand the market.<br>
It was necessary to understand the performance of students, how much is invested in each school, which indicators resulted in better results for Mathematics and Writing, among other questions.

## Business Assumptions
It is assumed that the schools belong to slightly different regions and that the culture in which they are located is similar. <br>
It is also understood that the school network wants to understand how the market works in order to take better advantage of it and improve its methods.

## Solution Strategy
To perform the analysis, we used only the Python Pandas library, as well as the creation of subtables for a better analysis.
* Step 01: Loading data and see the quality of it;
* Step 02: Data selection to answer business problems;
* Step 03: Data Analysis with Pandas to answer business problems.

## Data Insights
For this project, the objective was to understand, mainly, how the annual budget and the type of school influence school performance.

## Business Results
The allocation of resources is increasingly necessary because, despite the school's budget helping in student performance, there are many more factors that also help to improve school performance. 

## Conclusion
When carrying out the analysis, it was concluded that the annual budget influences school performance, however, it is not a determining factor for raising the grade of students. <br>
This becomes more evident when we analyze public and private schools, where public schools have a lower average grade, and a much lower approval rate, however, the annual budget is often equivalent to 3x the annual budget of a private school 

## Next Steps
* Accepting suggestions

## Disclaimer
A good part of this project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Real-Time Analytics with Python and Spark course (part of the Data Scientist training)
